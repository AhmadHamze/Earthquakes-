This is a processing.py project that maps earthquakes data from a csv file on a equirectangular projection of the earth.
You need to install processing and download the python package from the processing IDE.

You can use a different map (it has to be an equirectangular projection) with the code, but you need to rename it "WorldMap.svg".

The earthquake data is downloaded from "https://earthquake.usgs.gov".
